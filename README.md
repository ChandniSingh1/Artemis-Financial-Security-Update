# Project Two: Artemis Financial Software Security README

## Client Overview
Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company specializing in developing personalized financial plans for their clients. They approached us with two main software-related concerns: 

1. **Modernization**: They wanted to modernize their existing software infrastructure to ensure it remains competitive and efficient in the rapidly evolving financial sector.
   
2. **Security**: Addressing security vulnerabilities was a top priority. They recognized the critical importance of safeguarding their clients' sensitive financial data and preventing potential data breaches.

## Addressing Security Vulnerabilities
During our engagement with Artemis Financial, we focused on identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities within their software. Here's what we did well:

- **Comprehensive Assessment**: We conducted thorough security assessments to identify vulnerabilities, recognizing the importance of protecting against potential threats.

- **Prompt Mitigation**: When vulnerabilities were identified, we promptly addressed them, ensuring that the software was secure before moving forward.

## The Significance of Secure Coding
Secure coding is vital for several reasons:

- **Protection Against Data Breaches**: Secure code acts as a strong defense against security breaches, safeguarding sensitive financial data and preventing financial losses.

- **Building Trust**: Secure software builds trust with clients. Knowing their data is protected helps clients feel safe and confident in their financial plans.

- **Reputation**: Maintaining a reputation for secure software can have a positive impact on a company's overall wellbeing, attracting and retaining clients.

## Challenges and Insights
We encountered few issues during the security vulnerability assessment, and this process provided valuable insights:

- **Eye-Opening**: Discovering numerous security vulnerabilities was enlightening. It emphasized the importance of ongoing security measures.

## Enhancing Security
To increase layers of security in the future:

- **Regular Testing**: We recommend running periodic security vulnerability tests.
  
- **Software Updates**: Keeping software up-to-date is crucial for staying ahead of emerging threats.

- **Timely Issue Resolution**: Address security issues promptly instead of postponing them.

## Ensuring Functionality and Security
After code refactoring, we ensured functionality and security:

- **Updated Configuration**: We maintained an updated `pom.xml` file.

- **Continuous Testing**: We repeatedly ran vulnerability tests until all vulnerabilities were resolved, ensuring the software was both functional and secure.

## Valuable Resources and Practices
Resources, tools, and practices that proved helpful include:

- **SHA-256 and Encryption**: Understanding SHA-256 and encryption/decription practices can be valuable for future security-related tasks.

## Showcasing Achievements
For future employment opportunities, we can showcase:

- **Checksum Assignment**: Highlighting our successful collaboration with peers and the ability to overcome challenges as a team.

- **Determination**: Demonstrating our persistence in problem-solving and ensuring project success.

By addressing Artemis Financial's security concerns and modernizing their software, we not only contributed to their success but also gained valuable experience in software security, secure coding practices, and the importance of staying vigilant in the face of evolving threats.
